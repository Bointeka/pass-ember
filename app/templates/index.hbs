          PASS is an easy-to-use web application which supports and improves compliance to public and open access policies. With PASS, authors accepted manuscripts can be submitted to multiple repositories seamlessly at once. Researchers may be able to avoid paying Open Access {{#link-to 'about'}} publishing fees {{/link-to}} using PASS. PASS may also be able to save researchersâ€™ time and effort in submitting manuscripts by looking up their bibliographical information using DOIs and ORCiDs. {{#link-to 'about'}}More about Pass?{{/link-to}}
