            The university expects that every scholarly article produced by full-time faculty members be 
            accessible in an open access repository. This can be achieved through deposits into existing 
            public access repositories (such as PubMed Central, arXiv, etc.) and/or into Johns Hopkins 
            institutional repository, JScholarship.
